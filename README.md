# DarkNews

This repository contains Monte Carlo events for the dark neutrino models recently proposed to explain the MiniBooNE excess. All files contain truth level samples.  

Based on work described here: https://arxiv.org/abs/1812.08768

Event are provided in a HEPEVT format for MiniBooNE, MINERvA LE and ME, and CHARM-II for different Zprime and nu_4 masses. All other parameters are couplings that control the total rate.

The files include events from upscattering on nuclei as well as on protons, as indicated by the final state hadron.
